# Motivation

Improve our technical and communication skills by developing an open-source web-application together during WomenWhoCode hack nights.
We this, we want to give you something you can work on in our events and we want to make this project yours as well. Don't be shy to take ownership of it :)

# Topic of the Project

Make it easy to discover open-source project issues which are suitable for beginners.

# Code of Conduct

In order to make sure that everyone is respected and is on the same page, we have some guidelines which we would like you to follow:

- Do you have an idea to improve the project or you found a bug? Create a Github issue with that :) Make sure you describe it as best as you can and add a schema / image / gif if it helps you to express yourself better. Try to keep the context small as well. Don't be afraid of writing your ideas down!
- Do you have a question in an existing issue? Ask the creator by going to talk to her directly or by adding a comment in the issue. We are all learning here, so questions are always welcome!
- You don't know where to start? Assign an issue to you and start working on it :) For that, we would advise to:
  - Create a new branch locally with the issue number + title
  - Try to solve the issue. Try to name things clearly (again, feel free to discuss it with someone if needed) and take your time to solve your problem, we are not in a rush :)
  - Do regular commits of your development
  - Add unit tests! :D
  - Push your changes in to your branch at the end if each hack night if you are not finished with a description of what's done / what's missing or
  - Create a pull request (make sure all your tests pass before!) and assign someone to review it. Describe in the pull request what you have done and what problem does your solution solve
- Are you a reviewer?
  - Verify that all tests pass
  - Check if the pull request solves the problem
  - Check code readability and add comments if necessary if you don't understand something
- Have fun!
